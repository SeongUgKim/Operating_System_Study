## Intro to Processes

- process: running program (informal def)
- program: lifeless itself -> a bunch of instructions in disk
- os: running the program into something useful
- typical os maybe seemingly running tens or even hundreds of processes at the same time

### Time Sharing

- OS's virtualizing the CPU -> illusion that many virtual CPUs exists
- mechanisms: lovw-level methods or protocols that implment a needed piece of functionality
  - ex) context switch

### Policies

- poliices: algorithms for making some kind of decision within the os
  - ex) scheduling policy
